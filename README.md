# StudentDB
Here I'm working with WPF C# and SQL Server Management Studio. In DB I create 2 tables. There are Students' table and Groups' table. I bind Groups' table Id(Column) to Student's table GroupsId(Column)
* Firstly 
Start project 'StudentsDB' to create your database and tables in it
* Secondly
In project 'DataGridStudents' you can view the database's data
